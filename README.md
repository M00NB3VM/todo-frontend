# A mini to do list application

Built with Vue + Vite

Uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for API calls (where the todos are stored)

Made to connect to a small node server you can find [here](https://github.com/M00NB3VM/todo-backend)

Both this front end application and the server runs locally
